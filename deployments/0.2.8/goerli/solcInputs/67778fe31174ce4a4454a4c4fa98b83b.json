Logic remains unchanged.\n * Changes to the contract:\n * - Raised pragma version\n * - Removed an import of IStabilityPool Interface\n * Even though SafeMath is no longer required, the decision was made to keep it to avoid human factor errors\n *\n * The Stability Pool holds BaseFeeLMA tokens deposited by Stability Pool depositors.\n *\n * When a trove is liquidated, then depending on system conditions, some of its BaseFeeLMA debt gets offset with\n * BaseFeeLMA in the Stability Pool:  that is, the offset debt evaporates, and an equal amount of BaseFeeLMA tokens in the Stability Pool is burned.\n *\n * Thus, a liquidation causes each depositor to receive a BaseFeeLMA loss, in proportion to their deposit as a share of total deposits.\n * They also receive an WStETH gain, as the WStETH collateral of the liquidated trove is distributed among Stability depositors,\n * in the same proportion.\n *\n * When a liquidation occurs, it depletes every deposit by the same fraction: for example, a liquidation that depletes 40%\n * of the total BaseFeeLMA in the Stability Pool, depletes 40% of each deposit.\n *\n * A deposit that has experienced a series of liquidations is termed a \"compounded deposit\": each liquidation depletes the deposit,\n * multiplying it by some factor in range ]0,1[\n *\n *\n * --- IMPLEMENTATION ---\n *\n * We use a highly scalable method of tracking deposits and WStETH gains that has O(1) complexity.\n *\n * When a liquidation occurs, rather than updating each depositor's deposit and WStETH gain, we simply update two state variables:\n * a product P, and a sum S.\n *\n * A mathematical manipulation allows us to factor out the initial deposit, and accurately track all depositors' compounded deposits\n * and accumulated WStETH gains over time, as liquidations occur, using just these two variables P and S. When depositors join the\n * Stability Pool, they get a snapshot of the latest P and S: P_t and S_t, respectively.\n *\n * The formula for a depositor's accumulated WStETH gain is derived here:\n * https://github.com/liquity/dev/blob/main/papers/Scalable_Reward_Distribution_with_Compounding_Stakes.pdf\n *\n * For a given deposit d_t, the ratio P/P_t tells us the factor by which a deposit has decreased since it joined the Stability Pool,\n * and the term d_t * (S - S_t)/P_t gives us the deposit's total accumulated WStETH gain.\n *\n * Each liquidation updates the product P and sum S. After a series of liquidations, a compounded deposit and corresponding WStETH gain\n * can be calculated using the initial deposit, the depositor’s snapshots of P and S, and the latest values of P and S.\n *\n * Any time a depositor updates their deposit (withdrawal, top-up) their accumulated WStETH gain is paid out, their new deposit is recorded\n * (based on their latest compounded deposit and modified by the withdrawal/top-up), and they receive new snapshots of the latest P and S.\n * Essentially, they make a fresh deposit that overwrites the old one.\n *\n *\n * --- SCALE FACTOR ---\n *\n * Since P is a running product in range ]0,1] that is always-decreasing, it should never reach 0 when multiplied by a number in range ]0,1[.\n * Unfortunately, Solidity floor division always reaches 0, sooner or later.\n *\n * A series of liquidations that nearly empty the Pool (and thus each multiply P by a very small number in range ]0,1[ ) may push P\n * to its 18 digit decimal limit, and round it to 0, when in fact the Pool hasn't been emptied: this would break deposit tracking.\n *\n * So, to track P accurately, we use a scale factor: if a liquidation would cause P to decrease to <1e-9 (and be rounded to 0 by Solidity),\n * we first multiply P by 1e9, and increment a currentScale factor by 1.\n *\n * The added benefit of using 1e9 for the scale factor (rather than 1e18) is that it ensures negligible precision loss close to the\n * scale boundary: when P is at its minimum value of 1e9, the relative precision loss in P due to floor division is only on the\n * order of 1e-9.\n *\n * --- EPOCHS ---\n *\n * Whenever a liquidation fully empties the Stability Pool, all deposits should become 0. However, setting P to 0 would make P be 0\n * forever, and break all future reward calculations.\n *\n * So, every time the Stability Pool is emptied by a liquidation, we reset P = 1 and currentScale = 0, and increment the currentEpoch by 1.\n *\n * --- TRACKING DEPOSIT OVER SCALE CHANGES AND EPOCHS ---\n *\n * When a deposit is made, it gets snapshots of the currentEpoch and the currentScale.\n *\n * When calculating a compounded deposit, we compare the current epoch to the deposit's epoch snapshot. If the current epoch is newer,\n * then the deposit was present during a pool-emptying liquidation, and necessarily has been depleted to 0.\n *\n * Otherwise, we then compare the current scale to the deposit's scale snapshot. If they're equal, the compounded deposit is given by d_t * P/P_t.\n * If it spans one scale change, it is given by d_t * P/(P_t * 1e9). If it spans more than one scale change, we define the compounded deposit\n * as 0, since it is now less than 1e-9'th of its initial value (e.g. a deposit of 1 billion BaseFeeLMA has depleted to < 1 BaseFeeLMA).\n *\n *\n *  --- TRACKING DEPOSITOR'S WStETH GAIN OVER SCALE CHANGES AND EPOCHS ---\n *\n * In the current epoch, the latest value of S is stored upon each scale change, and the mapping (scale -> S) is stored for each epoch.\n *\n * This allows us to calculate a deposit's accumulated WStETH gain, during the epoch in which the deposit was non-zero and earned WStETH.\n *\n * We calculate the depositor's accumulated WStETH gain for the scale at which they made the deposit, using the WStETH gain formula:\n * e_1 = d_t * (S - S_t) / P_t\n *\n * and also for scale after, taking care to divide the latter by a factor of 1e9:\n * e_2 = d_t * S / (P_t * 1e9)\n *\n * The gain in the second scale will be full, as the starting point was in the previous scale, thus no need to subtract anything.\n * The deposit therefore was present for reward events from the beginning of that second scale.\n *\n *        S_i-S_t + S_{i+1}\n *      .<--------.------------>\n *      .         .\n *      . S_i     .   S_{i+1}\n *   <--.-------->.<----------->\n *   S_t.         .\n *   <->.         .\n *      t         .\n *  |---+---------|-------------|-----...\n *         i            i+1\n *\n * The sum of (e_1 + e_2) captures the depositor's total accumulated WStETH gain, handling the case where their\n * deposit spanned one scale change. We only care about gains across one scale change, since the compounded\n * deposit is defined as being 0 once it has spanned more than one scale change.\n *\n *\n * --- UPDATING P WHEN A LIQUIDATION OCCURS ---\n *\n * Please see the implementation spec in the proof document, which closely follows on from the compounded deposit / WStETH gain derivations:\n * https://github.com/liquity/liquity/blob/master/papers/Scalable_Reward_Distribution_with_Compounding_Stakes.pdf\n *\n *\n * --- HOG ISSUANCE TO STABILITY POOL DEPOSITORS ---\n *\n * A HOG issuance event occurs at every deposit operation, and every liquidation.\n *\n * Each deposit is tagged with the address of the front end through which it was made.\n *\n * All deposits earn a share of the issued HOG in proportion to the deposit as a share of total deposits. The HOG earned\n * by a given deposit, is split between the depositor and the front end through which the deposit was made, based on the front end's kickbackRate.\n *\n * Please see the system Readme for an overview:\n * https://github.com/liquity/dev/blob/main/README.md#hog-issuance-to-stability-providers\n *\n * We use the same mathematical product-sum approach to track HOG gains for depositors, where 'G' is the sum corresponding to HOG gains.\n * The product P (and snapshot P_t) is re-used, as the ratio P/P_t tracks a deposit's depletion due to liquidations.\n *\n */\ncontract StabilityPool is HedgehogBase, Ownable, CheckContract {\n    using LiquitySafeMath128 for uint128;\n    using SafeMath for uint256;\n    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;\n\n    string public constant NAME = \"StabilityPool\";\n\n    IBorrowerOperations public borrowerOperations;\n\n    ITroveManager public troveManager;\n\n    IBaseFeeLMAToken public baseFeeLMAToken;\n\n    // Needed to check if there are pending liquidations\n    ISortedTroves public sortedTroves;\n\n    ICommunityIssuance public communityIssuance;\n\n    uint256 internal WStETH; // deposited wStETH tracker\n    IERC20 public WStETHToken;\n\n    // Tracker for BaseFeeLMA held in the pool.
